text: We propose a novel machine learning problem â€“ the SRP problem as reconstructing high-quality data from unsatisfactory sensor data in industrial systems. A case study which performs SRP on smart meter data is then presented. A network, namely SRPNet, is proposed to generate high-frequency load data from low-frequency data. This technology makes it possible to empower existing industrial facilities without upgrading existing sensors or deploying additional sensors.
