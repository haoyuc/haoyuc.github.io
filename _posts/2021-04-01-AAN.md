text: Among recent advances in SISR, attention mechanisms are crucial for high performance SR models. However, few works really discuss why attention works and how it works. In this work, we attempt to quantify and visualize the static attention mechanisms and show that not all attention modules are equally beneficial. We then propose attention in attention network (AN) for highly accurate image SR. This allows attention modules to specialize to beneficial examples without otherwise penalties and thus greatly improve the capacity of the attention network with little parameter overhead.

## Create AP theme
This is about the ap project.  
I had a management page for my career.  
But this time, I decided to change to the github page.  
By the way, I did not have a favorite theme, so I customized it myself.  


## Tech
Now that I have a github page, I need to know ruby and jekyll.  
And, html, js, css or so?  


## Duration
It did not take long to change the existing theme.  
I made it by modifying the ["tale"](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale) theme.
