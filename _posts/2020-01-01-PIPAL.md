text: The Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods are developed to measure the perceptual quality of images. However, while new algorithms have been continuously improving image restoration performance, we notice an increasing inconsistency between quantitative results and perceptual quality. In this paper, we contribute a new large-scale IQA dataset and build benchmarks for IQA methods.

## Create AP theme
This is about the ap project.  
I had a management page for my career.  
But this time, I decided to change to the github page.  
By the way, I did not have a favorite theme, so I customized it myself.  


## Tech
Now that I have a github page, I need to know ruby and jekyll.  
And, html, js, css or so?  


## Duration
It did not take long to change the existing theme.  
I made it by modifying the ["tale"](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale) theme.
